This document describes what has been found to be the most reliable
procedure across the range of supported Android devices.

## Notes About Supported and Unsupported Devices

Unfortunately, we cannot support all Android devices that have been
made and may be used throughout the world. The reasons for the lack of
support are two things:

1. We unfortunately don't have the resources (time/money) to get each
   and every device for testing our SmartDrive App on, and

2. Many devices do not support the required Bluetooth capabilities
   that the SmartDrive App requires. These Bluetooth capabilities
   include allowing the smart-phone to act as a peripheral device
   instead of as the master of the Bluetooth communications. Even
   devices within the same product family or product line from a
   single manufacturer may differ in their support of these Bluetooth
   capabilities.
   
We apologize if you have a device that we do not support but want to
use the SmartDrive App to track your activity and to interface with
your PushTracker, and we are doing everything we can to expand the
range of supported devices, but for now our recommendations are to

1. Make sure your device is fully up to date with respect to the
   Android OS version as well as any device drivers included in system
   updates and if your device still does not work to

2. Try with a family member's device, e.g. family tablet or spouse's
   phone
